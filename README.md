## User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work...

WHEN I load their portfolio,
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation,
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work,
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application,
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications,
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices,
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
